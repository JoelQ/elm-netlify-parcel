# Minimal Elm + Parcel deploy to Netlify

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9429c584-fc7a-4812-9ebb-df8a3ae3ca92/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elm-netlify-parcel/deploys) [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/JoelQ/elm-netlify-parcel)

This is a minimal example [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) app that is deployed to
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (see the [live site](https://elm-netlify-parcel.netlify.app/)).

## Setting up Netlify

You can fork this repo in GitHub and set it up with Netlify builds by clicking
the "Deploy to Netlify" button. The `netlify.toml` file has the config set up
with the build command.

## Setup without parcel
